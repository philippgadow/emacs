# Emacs

## Introduction

The emacs editor is one of the most powerful and adaptable text-editing environments on the market. It is free software in every sense of the word and offers remarkable features.

A copy of emacs can be obtained on the [GNU emacs homepage](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

However, in inverse proportion to its power is the editor's initial learning-curve. It is invaluable to have access to good tutorials, a number of which is listed here:

- [LaTeX with emacs](http://latex.tugraz.at/programme/emacs)

A short reference distilled from above tutorials is given in the following.
